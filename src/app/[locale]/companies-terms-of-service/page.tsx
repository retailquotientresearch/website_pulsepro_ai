                Please note that Pulse Business Solutions Inc is a technology services provider that offers many different products and services. In particular, It has developed a software-based platform that assists authorized users in scheduling workers on an as-needed basis by, among other things, allowing such users to connect with independent contractors (each a “Contractor”) for various short term assignments. The platform may also be utilized to locate workers for longer-term engagements.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#111111] mb-6">2. THE SERVICES</h2>
              <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p><strong>2.1 Grant of Access and Use.</strong> Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and payment of any applicable fees for the Services, Pulse grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferrable right to access and use the Pulse Platform (including installing and using the Pulse App on your mobile devices) and any content, information and related materials made available through the Pulse Platform, in order to: (i) submit Work Requests to schedule Contractors for various short term assignments; (ii) manage the work schedules of your workers up to the number of authorized workers and/or the number of authorized locations; and (iii) publish job postings to recruit, identify, and hire job seekers. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Pulse, its affiliates, and their respective licensors.</p>
                <p><strong>2.2 Work Requests.</strong> Customer may submit a Work Request via the Pulse Platform or otherwise. Each such Work Request may be posted on the Pulse Platform (including on the Pulse App or web portal) and/or sent to Contractors as a Pulse Notice. Once you have been matched with a Contractor and have agreed upon the terms of a Work Request, the Work Request will become a “Services Engagement.” Pulse can reject any Work Request that is not appropriate or that violates the terms of this Agreement or Pulse’s policies.</p>
                <p><strong>2.3 Direct Hires.</strong> Customer may utilize the Pulse Platform to publish job openings to potential candidates. In the event you or someone acting on your behalf hires (including a full-time hire, part-time hire, independent contractor hire, intern hire, or any other such engagement) a job candidate identified via the Pulse Platform or a Contractor that has performed a Services Engagement for you, you agree to notify Pulse of such hire (each a (<strong>Direct Hire</strong>)). Any engagement where you provide compensation directly to a Contractor within twelve (12) months of the last Services Engagement performed for you by such Contractor shall be considered a Direct Hire regardless of whether the Contractor contacted you independently or in response to a public job posting. If you make a Direct Hire, you acknowledge and agree you must sign a contract directly with the job candidate. Upon request, Pulse may facilitate this process by sending the contract to the job candidate, but it is your responsibility to ensure it is signed and returned before the job candidate begins. You acknowledge and agree that, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Pulse, Pulse has no responsibility for making any payments to the job candidate and you are solely responsible for paying the agreed-upon compensation set forth in the contract directly to such job candidate. Although job openings posted in the Pulse Platform may include a job description, an estimate of the compensation, and other relevant details, the information provided by Pulse does not control. Rather, the terms and conditions contained in the contract between you and the job candidate shall control.</p>
                <p><strong>2.4 Accounts.</strong> In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active account in the Pulse Platform (“Account”). Account registration requires you to submit to Pulse certain personal information, such as your name, company name, street address, email address, and phone number, as well as a valid payment method. You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account, including billing information. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information may result in your inability to access and use the Services and the Pulse Platform. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. You will immediately notify Pulse of any actual or suspected breach or improper use or disclosure of your password.</p>
                <p><strong>2.5 Account Requirements and Conduct.</strong> You may not authorize third parties to use your Account without prior approval from Pulse. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes. You will not use the Services to cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to Pulse, a Contractor, or any other party.</p>
                <p><strong>2.6 Text Messaging, Network Access and Devices.</strong> By creating an Account, you agree that Pulse may send you informational text (SMS) messages as part of your use of the Pulse Platform, and that use of SMS may be necessary to utilize certain features of Services. You can cancel the SMS service at any time by replying “STOP” in the text message you received. It may take a few days for Pulse to process your request. You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services and Pulse Platform. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Pulse Platform from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible devices necessary to access and use the Services and the Pulse Platform and any updates thereto. Pulse does not guarantee, warrant or represent that the Services, the Pulse Platform or any portion thereof will function on any particular device.</p>
                <p><strong>2.7 Restrictions.</strong> You may not: (i) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from any portion of the Pulse Platform; (ii) reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, lease, sell, resell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Services or Pulse Platform except as expressly permitted by Pulse; (iii) decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the Pulse Platform except as may be permitted by applicable law; (iv) link to, mirror or frame any portion of the Services or Pulse Platform; (v) cause or launch any programs or scripts for the purpose of scraping, indexing, surveying, or otherwise data mining any portion of the Services or Pulse Platform, or unduly burdening or hindering the operation and/or functionality of any aspect of the Services or Pulse Platform; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or impair any aspect of the Services, the Pulse Platform, or related systems or networks. In addition, you shall not, and shall not allow any other party to, access or use the Pulse Platform to design or develop a competitive or substantially similar product or service.</p>
                <p><strong>2.8 Third Party Services and Content.</strong> The Services may be made available in connection with third party services and content that Pulse does not control, including but not limited to payment processing services. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of such third party services and content. Pulse has no control over and does not endorse such third party services and content and in no event shall Pulse be responsible or liable for any interactions you may have with such third parties.</p>

              <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p><strong>3.1 Engagement Fees.</strong> Unless you are using a free version of the Services and Pulse Platform, in consideration of Pulse’s provision of the Services and Pulse Platform for your use and benefit hereunder, you agree to pay Pulse the fees (<strong>Fees</strong>) set forth in the Order, including: (i) for each Services Engagement (“Engagement Fee”); (ii) for each location whose workers’ are scheduled utilizing the Pulse Platform (“Scheduling Fee”); and (iii) for each Direct Hire you make of job seekers using the Pulse Platform (“Direct Hire Fee”). The Fees, if any, will be invoiced according to the payment terms set forth in the Order.</p>
                <p><strong>3.2 Contractor Payments.</strong> Once a Services Engagement is completed by a Contractor, unless arrangements have been made for you to pay the Contractor directly, Pulse will facilitate your payment of the applicable Contractor Payment on behalf of the Contractor, as such Contractor’s limited payment collection agent. A Services Engagement shall be considered complete once the services have been performed by the applicable Contractor. After collection of the Engagement Fee for a completed Services Engagement from you, Pulse will pay the Contractor Payment to the applicable Contractor. In some situations, you may have the opportunity to negotiate the Contractor Payment directly with the Contractor for services received by you from such Contractor at the time you receive such services. Pulse will respond accordingly to any request from a Contractor to modify the Contractor Payment for a particular Services Engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>3.3 Late Cancellation Fee.</strong> In the event you cancel a Services Engagement within 24 hours before the start time of the Services Engagement, you will be required to pay the total Engagement Fee for the Services Engagement. In the event that you cancel a Services Engagement between 72 and 24 hours before the start time of the Services Engagement, you will be required to pay fifty percent (50%) of the Engagement Fee for the Services Engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>3.4 Taxes; General.</strong> The Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You and, as applicable, Contractors, are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with the Fees and purchases hereunder. If Pulse has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you. The Fees paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Pulse.</p>
                <p><strong>3.5 Gratuity.</strong> Contractor Payments are intended to fully compensate the applicable Contractor for each completed Services Engagement. Pulse does not designate any portion of the Contractor Payment as a tip or gratuity to the Contractor. You are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Contractor, but you are under no obligation to do so. After you have received services from a Contractor and a Services Engagement is completed, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about the applicable Contractor.</p>
                <p><strong>3.6 Late Payment.</strong> In the event that there are unpaid or past due amounts for Fees associated with your Account, you must pay a finance charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law on such outstanding balances, plus all expenses of collection.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#111111] mb-6">8. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PULSE, CONTRACTORS AND CUSTOMERS; INSURANCE</h2>
              <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p><strong>8.1 Contractors.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Pulse Platform to arrange and obtain services from a Contractor creates a direct business relationship between you and that Contractor, and your interactions and dealings with such Contractor are solely between you and such Contractor. Contractors are independent contractors and are not employees or agents of Pulse. You agree to provide the Contractors with a safe, suitable workplace and equipment, and to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local employment laws including appropriate workplace-specific safety and health training that adequately addresses potential hazards at your worksite. You supervise, direct, and control the work performed by Contractors, and assume responsibility for all operational results, including losses or damage to property or data in the care, custody, or control of such Contractors. Pulse is not responsible or liable for the actions or inactions of any Contractor in relation to any services they perform. Pulse does not guarantee or warrant the Contractors’ performance of the Work Requests or the outcome or quality of the Services Engagements. If the Contractors have access to unattended premises or the care, custody, or control of case, checks, credit card numbers, ATM bank cards, negotiables, confidential information, trade secrets or other valuable property, you must take reasonable steps to safeguard such items and you acknowledge and agree that Pulse is not responsible for any resulting loss or damage.</p>
                <p><strong>8.2 Documentation.</strong> Pulse will, at your written request, conduct criminal history checks, employment eligibly verification, and drug screens as permitted by state law. The costs vary depending upon the specific test or report ordered and the charges will be agreed upon prior to ordering the tests and/or reports. Pulse will provide Contractors for positions requiring specific licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations, registrations, or certifications, if notified in writing prior to an assignment. You must notify Pulse in advance, so Contractors who are qualified to meet your specifications can be assigned. Although Pulse may independently verify a Contractor’s documentation from time to time as Pulse deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion, you are responsible for verifying a Contractor’s qualifications and Pulse is not responsible if you fail to ensure a Contractor is qualified.</p>
                <p><strong>8.3 Pulse and Customer Relationship.</strong> The parties expressly agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency agreement exists between you and Pulse as a result of this Agreement or any use of the Services, including the Pulse Platform.</p>
                <p><strong>8.4 Contractor Classification.</strong> You assume all liability for proper classification of Contractors as independent contractors based on applicable legal guidelines. This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency relationship between you and a Contractor. Contractor does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on your behalf. Pulse does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control any Contractor’s work or services performed in any manner. Pulse does not set any Contractor’s work hours or location of work, nor is Pulse involved in determining the type or manner of compensation to be paid for any Work Request or Services Engagement. Pulse will not provide any Contractor with training or any equipment, labour or materials needed for a particular Services Engagement. Pulse will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes as it would in the case of an employee. Customer and each Contractor will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority, in any nation, with respect to Contractor’s performance of Services Engagements and any related services. Except for Direct Hires, you may not require an exclusive relationship between you and a Contractor. A Contractor is free at all times to perform Services Engagements, be employed by or otherwise engage with persons or businesses other than you, including any of your competitors. You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Pulse from any and all claims arising out of or related to a Services Engagement, including but not limited to claims that Contractor was misclassified as an independent contractor, any liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that Contractor was misclassified (including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees), any claim that Pulse was an employer or joint employer of a Contractor, as well as claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, as well as any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker’s compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.</p>
